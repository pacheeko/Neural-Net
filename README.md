# Neural-Net

Application that allows for the training of neural nets to accurately predict numbers using the MNIST dataset, letters using the notMNIST dataset, or if a person is likely to have a heart attack based on medical information.

Run MNIST_starter.py to train a net on the MNIST dataset. The trained net will be stored in the part1.pkl file.

Run notMNIST_starter.py to train a net on the notMNIST dataset. The trained net will be stored in the part2.pkl file.

Run heart_starter.py to train a net on the heart.csv file. The trained net will be stored in the part3.pkl file.
